Zayn and Owens interrupt. Zayn says they put an end to all of this tomorrow night, one and for all. But tonight, before they take the Usos tag titles, they are going to make sure there is nothing left unsaid between them. Owens says there is something he needs the Usos to know. He’s conflicted about what he has to do Saturday night. The Usos were the first two guys to make him feel welcome when he first arrived in WWE. He used to look up to them like many used to.</p><p>He lost all respect for them when they started doing their cousin’s bidding. Jey looks away. Owens tells Jey to look at him when he’s talking to him. Owens can see it in their eyes. The Usos know what’s about to happen. It’s not paranoia, it’s going to be Zayn and Owens taking their tag team titles. Jimmy says Zayn and Owens wish they had what The Usos do. They ain’t blood. Zayn says the thing Jimmy is forgetting is it’s about more than blood. It’s about loyalty. Jey gets in Zayn’s face and says Jey knows nothing about loyalty. Zayn was loyal to Jey long before he was to him. The Usos picked blood over loyalty when they chose Roman Reigns.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><h4 id=h-check-out-last-week-s-coverage-wwe-smackdown-results-3-17-23>Check out last week’s coverage: <a href=#>WWE SmackDown Results (3/17/23)</a></h4><p>Zayn and Owens are going to put the Usos out of their misery.
