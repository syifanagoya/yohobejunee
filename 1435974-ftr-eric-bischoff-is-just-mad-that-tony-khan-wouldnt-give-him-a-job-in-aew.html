While discussing why they chose to sign with the company, Harwood brought up the fact that people like Bischoff wouldn’t have a podcast career right now if it weren’t for Tony Khan and AEW.</p><p>“I don’t think Tony Khan gets the credit that he deserves because he afforded a lot of people, a lot of jobs, and a lot of income,” Dax Harwood said. “I mean, even if you look outside of AEW, you got all these old-time, miserable podcasters like Eric Bischoff and some of the others who make a living just by going on their podcasts and burying Tony and AEW when they know that AEW is a place where business is thriving.</p><p>“Where AEW is a place that is helping change professional wrestling for the positive. So not only did Tony give us and hundreds of other people living. He’s afforded a living to some people who otherwise would be sitting miserable, bankrupt in their house.”</p><p>Cash Wheeler would chime in to speculate that Bischoff is likely mad that he wasn’t offered a job with the company by Tony after appearing on the show a few times and collecting a paycheck.</p><p>“I think he’s really mad that Tony wouldn’t give him a job the few times he was there to collect the paycheck,” Cash Wheeler said with a laugh. “Here comes bankruptcy number four!”</p><h2 id=h-ftr-believes-eric-bischoff-is-only-trashing-aew-for-clicks-and-views>FTR believes Eric Bischoff is only trashing AEW for clicks and views</h2><p>Harwood believes there are quite a few wrestling podcasters who would love a job with All Elite Wrestling and only started talking crap about the company after it was clear to them that Khan wasn’t offering them a job.</p><p>“There’s a couple of podcasters out there that bury AEW that would love a job with Tony,” Dax Harwood said. “There’s one or two that wouldn’t. But I know there’s quite a few that glowingly talked about AEW initially, and when Tony didn’t give them a job, now all of a sudden, they’re talking crap about it? Eh, that don’t make sense to me.”</p><p>When asked about the recent back and forth between Khan and Bischoff on social media, Harwood said it’s a calling the kettle black situation.</p><p>“Did you see the response that I gave to him? I mean, that’s all that needs to be said,” Dax Harwood said. “I mean, he went on national television and asked for a professional wrestling match with Vince McMahon at his pay-per-view.</p><p>“It’s the whole calling the kettle black thing. That’s all he’s doing. He’s doing it for clicks. He’s doing it for views, but also, man, I’ve said it about 100 times in this interview. This is how I give my family a living. This is how I put food in their mouth. And if you’re going to try to bury the place that I work and make it look less than, then you make it personal with me.”</p><p><a href=#>Dax Harwood Reflects On Double Dog Collar Match Against The Briscoes</a></p><p>What do you make of FTR’s comments?
