That's according to a Realtor.com report that the pair have listed the hillside property they purchased in the summer of 2018 for a little over $15.6 million.</p><p>The 12,900-square-foot home with six bedrooms and 12 bathrooms technically dates back to 1995, but it seems that Pratt and Schwarzenegger remodeled it so extensively that it might as well be a brand-new house. Its official real estate listing has it having been constructed in 2021, and the home has been a fixture of the couple's social media accounts over the course of their renovation project. And it was also featured on an episode of the Netflix home renovation reality series "Get Organized with The Home Edit."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-352211 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1478942443.jpg alt width=900 height=650 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-352211 class=wp-caption-text>Albert L.
