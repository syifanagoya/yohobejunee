There is only one place to really prove that - right here, in AEW. Even if you think you are the best in the world.”</p><p>When asked about that line, Punk said: “Um, I think Darby Allin’s great. I think everybody in the wrestling world needs to never do a dive ever again because you can’t do it better than Darby.”</p><p>Punk would take it a step further and note that Allin might have been talking about someone else. Someone who has also been linked with making a move to AEW. Someone like Daniel Bryan.</p><p>“Hey listen, ‘Best In the World’, that could be anybody,” Punk said. “That’s [Daniel] Bryan, right? That’s my assumption. I hear ‘Best In the World’ and I think Bryan.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/08/Punk-Bryan.jpeg><p>Bryan has also been heavily linked with AEW. The Leader of the Yes Movement let his contract expire in WWE earlier this year a couple of weeks after main eventing WrestleMania 37 with Roman Reigns and Edge</p><p>The 40 year old had said he wanted to spend more time with his young children and has been doing that for the past five months, but the opportunity to work with AEW would make a lot of sense on many levels.</p><p>Bryan has been open about wanting to work with a number of people in AEW and indeed, New Japan. That’s possible if he signs for AEW, but in a WWE world, it is not.</p><p>Furthermore, AEW works a much lighter schedule than WWE. Bryan can work Dynamite and spend the rest of the week with his family if he wants to.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/DB1.jpeg><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bodyslam.net</a> reported that Bryan is already locked in with AEW and the target debut for him is at the Arthur Ashe stadium in New York on September 22.</p><p>Punk and Bryan have, of course, worked together before in WWE and wrestled over the WWE title during Punk’s then-record-setting run of 434 days.</p><p>Both men would provide an amazing injection for AEW in what is already a hot wrestling product.</p><p>Punk’s rumoured debut is only eight days away on the August 20 edition of AEW Rampage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraK%2BimsC1uMinnmhxYmqGdn%2BOnKRmqKWjuG6txLBkm52jqXqquoytn55lp6S%2FrbCMnZinoZWheqO%2B2JqlaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
