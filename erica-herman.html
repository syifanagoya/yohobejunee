Despite being labeled a ‘gold-digger’ by numerous media outlets, many of Woods’ admirers believe that she is a devoted and loyal companion.&nbsp;</p><p>Herman’s affectionate relationship with Woods’ children is evident in the photos that capture her playing with them in public spaces. Her refined and compassionate demeanor is indicative of her classy and gentle nature.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the negative publicity that has surrounded her since her <a href=#>relationship</a> with Woods was made public, Herman remains dignified and poised in her dealings with the media.</p><p>The complaint states that Erica Herman had entered into a nondisclosure agreement with golfer Tiger Woods in January 2014. This was during their six-year relationship which began in 2013 and ended recently.&nbsp;</p><p>Herman is now seeking to nullify the accompanying agreement so that she may be free to speak openly and publicly about their relationship.</p><p>This comes as a formality following their break up, and the outcomes of the legal dispute will likely shape public opinion about the dynamics of the former couple’s time together. It certainly is a situation worth monitoring as we learn more in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Woods and Herman’s relationship had only recently become public knowledge due to the lawsuit Herman filed in March 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Sources had identified that the two began dating in 2017 and were regularly seen together at important golf events, such as the 2019 Masters and the Presidents Cup event.</p><p>With her absence from both the Hero World Challenge and Genesis Invitational of December, rumor mills began to speculate why she wasn’t present.&nbsp;</p><p>It was finally confirmed when Herman filed a lawsuit against Woods to nullify their non-disclosure agreement due to Speak Out Act involving s*xual assault or harassment – clearly implying something had occurred between Woods and Herman.</p><p>Woods and Herman enjoyed a long-standing relationship that consisted of both professional and personal elements.&nbsp;</p><p>However, their split’s exact duration is unknown, although reports suggest that they have not been seen together in several months. The last sighting of them as a couple was in 2022 at the World Golf Hall of Fame, where Woods was being inducted; his mother and children were also present.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Erica Herman’s bio</h2><p>Born in Florida and growing up in Palm Beach County, Herman is no newbie to the Sunshine State.
