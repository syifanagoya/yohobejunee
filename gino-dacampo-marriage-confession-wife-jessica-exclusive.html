My wife always says to me, actually, she said this last week. <strong>She said, 'We've been together now for 27 years and married for 20 years… I have to say after 27 years, you make me feel that every day is a 'date' day.'</strong></p><p id=eihqb1AgosB8 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>The UK's 10 most successful celebrity chefs revealed</a></strong></p><p id=emz8oqeJXbW5 data-wc=1><strong>Exclusive: <a class=hm-link href=#>Nadiya Hussain reveals sweet tradition she's passed down to her kids</a></strong></p><p id=en5oovqhLeGA data-wc=47>"Because you know sometimes we have this [pressure] to do a date night or we have to buy flowers or buy the chocolate.

They were married in 2002 when Gino was 24 and went on to welcome three children; Luciano, 19, Rocco, 16, and eight-year-old daughter Mia.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/afb3ea49d09a-gino-dacampo-family-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eG-5IWT3K6JH8 data-wc=6><strong>Gino and Jessica share three children</strong></p><p id=eUQxvlGRrwPBj data-wc=47>Despite two decades of marriage, milestone anniversaries are not celebrated in the D'Acampo household. "I don't do anything on anniversaries because I'm not the kind of guy who buys a card or flowers or anything like that for the anniversary - I do that anyway," he explained.</p><p id=eLVbBcZeALGN5 data-wc=23><strong>"But clearly when you wake up your anniversary, we have a special hug in the morning and we just get on with [life]."</strong></p><p id=ee6POQ-w7T-GM data-wc=37>Asked whether the children help with the cooking at home, Gino confirmed that it's certainly a family affair. However, he and his wife Jessica avoid partnering up in the kitchen as it can lead to some disagreements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/828e2a0f3086-gino-wife-jessica-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e31hAqmZGwNph data-wc=9><strong>The couple have been together for nearly three decades</strong></p><p id=ehqRpfWQulkvK data-wc=58>"Me and my children cook together but it doesn't happen often because you can imagine our life is so hectic," he divulged. "I don't know, most of the time I have no idea when I'm coming back home so I never have the chance to cook with my kids as much as I would like to do it.</p><p id=e4xXf-UJtOTYP data-wc=50>"But whenever I get the chance, yes. There is always someone in the kitchen with me but not my wife though. Not my wife because we argue in the kitchen. She says that she knows best but I say that I know best. So it's always one or the other."</p><p id=e5ASjyDpTP2Sw data-wc=52>Although the couple are very passionate about their cuisine, Gino was full of praise for his wife. <strong>"She's a great cook," he added. "I would say 80 per cent&nbsp;of the time it's done by her and 20 per cent&nbsp;of the time it's done by me because I come home late."</strong></p><p id=e77QwGq9KZWT1><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/73b589fcd8f8-inside-luciano-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p style=text-align:center id=es1Do3ozVI0d9 data-wc=6><strong>Inside Luciano at ME Hotel London</strong></p><p id=enjV1bv-GdT9V data-wc=41>Meanwhile, over the past few weeks, proud dad Gino has been helping his eldest son Luciano make his name in the world of cuisine.
