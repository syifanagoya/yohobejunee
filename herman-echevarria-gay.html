The likelihood of infuriated spirits tracking us all down and forcing us to believe in karma for discussing the sex life of a deceased person is considerable. If my fingers fall off at random, I will report. But anyway.</p><p>The rumors about his sexual orientation started swirling in the early 2010s. He seemingly didn't address the rumors, but it's not uncommon for Real Housewives partners to choose to stay in the background.</p><p>Karent Sierra and <a href=#>Joanna Krupa</a> publicly aired the rumors about Herman being gay back in 2012. Alexia addressed the rumors via a blog post published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bravo</a>.</p><p>"Joanna is crazy, volatile, and aggressive. Karent is a clown, a liar, and passive-aggressive. Together they are the Devilish Duo!" Alexia wrote. "I was hurt and disgusted when I saw Karent and Joanna trying to stir up nonsense about my relationship of 13 years with my husband, Herman."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Herman is an exceptional man, human being, husband, and father, which is more than they can say about their men," she added.
