The pair, who originally connected as friends, became more serious during quarantine, but Doute noted to <a href=#>Life & Style</a> in August of that year that she wasn’t trying to “rush” into marriage.</p><p>“I think Alex and I are just doing it the way that’s right for us,” the Michigan native told the outlet. “We’ve had that conversation, of course. I think we’re both in the right place at the right time of our lives and if it happens, it happens.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kristen-Doute-After-Split-From-Alex-Menache-3.jpg><p>The couple <a href=#>moved in together</a> in December 2021 with Doute selling her $1.3 million Valley Village home. Things seemed to be looking up for the duo as they continued to post sweet photos together on each other’s respective Instagram pages.</p><p>It all went south this past week, however, as fans pointed out that the He’s Making You Crazy author and her real estate beau were no longer following each other on the social media platform. Users also speculated about a breakup when Doute seemingly hinted <a href=#>the end of her relationship</a> with an Instagram caption introducing “the new me.”</p><p>The T-shirt designer ultimately confirmed the split by responding to fan comments, explaining that her relationship with Menache simply “didn’t work out.” Other screenshots shared by a <a href=#>Bravo fan account</a> also showed how Doute added, “Alex is a wonderful man who I love and respect very much.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaa6jJ2mrqyVYsSiutOsZK2nXZeybrLRnpxmmZapsrN5wKWcsWWdmruir8eeZKyonJ7BcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
