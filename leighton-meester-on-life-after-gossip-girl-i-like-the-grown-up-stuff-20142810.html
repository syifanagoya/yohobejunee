The Gossip Girl alum, 28, whose costar <strong><a href=#>Blake Lively</a></strong> <a href=#>announced her first pregnancy</a> earlier this month, secretly married hubby <strong><a href=#>Adam Brody</a></strong> back in February, and has been seeing a lot of her other friends experience big life changes, too.&nbsp;</p><p>“Most people I know are starting to get married. It’ll be kids next,” she told Nylon. “I like the grown-up stuff. I like having a house. I’ve got dogs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The couple is currently promoting their upcoming film Life Partners, in which Meester plays a lesbian in love with her best friend who starts dating Brody, 34.&nbsp;</p><p>“There wasn’t time to ask if we wanted to do this together,” Meester said of mixing her personal and professional life. “I was reading the script. I loved the part and loved the movie. I was going to the meeting that day and he called me and said, ‘They offered me this role.’”</p><p>Since her hit CW show ended in 2012, Meester has been focusing on projects that won’t pigeonhole her as a character actress.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I started the show when I was so young, and once it was over, I wanted to do things that were more exciting and challenging and more me — more my adult taste,” the star who played the bossy-yet-beloved Blair Waldorf on the New York-based show said. “Of course, that’s said with nothing but gratitude and love for that experience in that time of my life.”</p><p>The actress has also dabbled in music, noting that her role as a singer in 2010’s Country Strong gave her confidence musically that she had never received before.&nbsp;</p><p>“[I] finally thought I could find the words, the feeling, the meaning, and the melody that would showcase my voice,” she said. Her debut album Heartstrings was released on Tuesday, Oct. 28.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOeoZedwbC6jKacnqukmr9uu81mo6KelWKup8DEq2Sgp6OotrF5xqKppWWZYrmqt8Rmq6GdXZy%2FsMPNZqypZaOpwqeyjGtnamxibX5x</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
