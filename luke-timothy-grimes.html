He graduated from Dayton Christian High School in the early 2000s and relocated to New York to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.</p><p>Luke Grimes is best known as rugged cowboy Kayce Dutton on <a href=#>Yellowstone</a>, but his acting career started 15 years ago. Before portraying the youngest Dutton sibling, the 38-year-old actor starred in TV shows and movies, notably Brothers & Sisters, American Sniper, and the Fifty Shades trilogy.&nbsp;</p><p>The dynamic actor has an upcoming role alongside Ellie Kemper in a Netflix rom-com called Happiness for Beginners, based on a Katherine Center novel, but his fans want to know about his off-screen life.</p><p>Luke tends to keep his private life, well, private, which is no small feat for the star of one of the most-watched shows on television. The Dayton, Ohio-born actor stays off social media and keeps his interviews focused on <a href=#>business</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luke Grimes Wife</h2><p>The Yellowstone star lives happily with his wife, Bianca Rodrigues Grimes. The actor has been married to model Bianca Rodrigues since 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple just celebrated their third wedding anniversary on November 21. Last year, Bianca posted a beautiful photo of the two of them to celebrate.</p><p>From Bianca’s Instagram, we can tell that she has a super successful career as a model and enjoys traveling with Luke to Montana, where he films Yellowstone.&nbsp;</p><p>This past summer, she posted quite a few photos from Montana, including some sunsets and a birthday shot. It looks like she and Luke took a road trip there from California.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luke Grimes Kids</h2><p>Currently, they do not share any child and seem not interested in growing their family any time soon. Moreover, it feels like Luke will be focusing more on his career path.</p><p>Previously grime had one relationship in the past. Luke Grimes’s dated actress Gillian Zinser, but they split up for some unknown reason.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Luke Grimes Net Worth</h2><p>As of February 2022, Luke Grimes’ reported net worth is hovering around $500,000. The number might seem low for a steadily employed actor, but it appears to be a pre-Yellowstone estimate, so it’s a safe bet Grimes’ bank account has grown a bit in the past two years.&nbsp;</p><p>His Yellowstone co-star Kevin Costner makes $500,000 per episode — and while it’s unlikely that Grimes, who doesn’t have the same name recognition as Costner, earns that much for his performance on the show, we’re betting his salary is quite sizable.</p><p>Luke Grimes, the star behind Yellowstone’s Kayce Dutton, recently talked about his experience working with Hollywood impact Kevin Costner. It motivated him to become a better actor working in the same field.</p><p>Yellowstone instantly became a hit for the director and showrunner Taylor Sheridan. The series’s success is partly due to Costner’s skilled characterization of ranch owner and family patriarch John Dutton.&nbsp;</p><p>In a conference with Monsters and Critics, Grimes opened up his experience operating alongside Costner and acknowledged that he was a little determined. The actor claimed:</p><p>“<strong>Working with someone who is that awe-inspiring and whose career is that legendary is always sort of a pinch-me moment, like, ‘Is this for real?</strong>“</p><p>Costner held his first leading role in the 1987 picture The Untouchables. Subsequently, Costner has become one of today’s most widely known American film stars.</p><p>“<strong>It feels like a benchmark in your own career, and you try to soak in as much knowledge as you can,</strong>” Grimes acclaimed.</p><p>Despite Costner’s heavy success, Grimes explains that Hollywood stars’ passion for filmmaking has yet to fade. Grimes revealed that Costner likes to “<strong>dissect</strong>” scenes to milk everything possible out of the fictional moment.</p><p>“<strong>One thing that I really enjoy to see in him is his passion for the work. It’s still very much in that exact place</strong>,” Grimes continued, later adding. <strong>“He still wants to work and is still the same very curious guy and still wants to dissect the scenes and get everything out of the scene that he possibly can.”</strong></p><p>Grimes ranked on the list of most popular TV Actors, and he is also ranked in the elite list of famous celebrities born in the United States. Luke Grimes celebrates his birthday on January 21 of every year.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC41KScZqyZory1tNhmnquhnZrAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
