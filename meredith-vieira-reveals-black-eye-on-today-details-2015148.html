As she revealed to co-host <strong>Hoda Kotb </strong>(and Today‘s many viewers), she was using them to cover up a pretty painful-looking black eye.</p><p>“If you’re going to laugh, I’m not going to tell you [what happened],” she told Kotb on Aug. 14 before launching into the story.</p><p>“I went to the bathroom,” she began. “I had to go to the bathroom and I didn’t put the light on. And to get to the bathroom, you go through a little dressing room. And I had just come back from Los Angeles…and the suitcase is black, and the room is black — it’s dark.”</p><p>Vieira explained that while she wasn’t “exhausted,” per se, it was the middle of the night. “And so I go to the bathroom, and I forget the suitcase is there. And I fell over the suitcase, and I hit my head on the rim of the dressing room table,” she shared.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=350 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Meredith Vieira" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The journalist’s husband, <strong>Richard M. Cohen</strong>, offered his own version of events on <a href=#>his blog</a>, which Kotb read from during Friday’s show.</p><p>“I am the one in my house who has multiple sclerosis,” he wrote. “I am the only one who is legally blind. I have limited depth perception and glance off doorways if I am not careful — and I am very cautious — because my lateral perception also is deficient. Yet I survive because I have learned self–preservation. I am married to a woman who has not.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He went on to joke about his wife’s clumsiness. “Meredith is a klutz, like a drunken sailor on a bender who collides with stationary objects and is a danger to herself,” he quipped. Of her fall, he added, “The dog was so embarrassed for her he did not even bark.”</p><p>Vieira’s doctor, on the other hand, was “concerned about a possible concussion” and requested a CT scan. “What did they see? I asked. A brain, by any chance?” Cohen cracked.</p><p>All joking aside, the View alum said she’s lucky that she walked away with just a black eye. “If it had been a little lower, something bad could have happened. Something really bad,” she admitted. “My head hurts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSeqpWZtrW0jK%2BgnqGilnqzsdWemKWrXZe5oq%2FKZpyynV2ku27Azp2YsmWUmsGitcusZGtoYWp%2BdYQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
