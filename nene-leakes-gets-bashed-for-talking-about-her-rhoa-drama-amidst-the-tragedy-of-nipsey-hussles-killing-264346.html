You caught me on a bad night. I just found out Nipsey Hussle died and this shit just looks ridiculous!!! Real shit is happening in this world. I follow you, and I have been a ride or die fan for years but COME THE FU*K ON! You are making it hella hard to defend you.

Who gives a RATS ASS who she invited to a party‼️’</p><p>Another follower said ‘Omg take the high road. In the end, does it really matter?
