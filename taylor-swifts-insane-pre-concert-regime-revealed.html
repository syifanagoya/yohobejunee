I finally, for the very first time, physically prepared correctly. I wanted to be so over-rehearsed that I could be silly with the fans and not lose my train of thought. Learning choreography is not my strong suit.”</p><p id=ehzk7JINPwn data-wc=21>Taylor began her intense training regimen six months before the Eras Tour kicked off in March in Glendale, Arizona last year.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/731ef62f6703-gettyimages-2155219248.jpg><p id=eVXTF_VFx-A data-wc=29>Her training routine included daily treadmill sessions where she would run while singing the entire Eras setlist aloud—running for fast songs and jogging or walking quickly for slower songs.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJk-ey_Qy9 data-wc=21>This was complemented by a specialized strength, conditioning, and weights program at her gym, Dogpound, and three months of dance lessons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2c6a218eae16-gettyimages-478805166.jpg><p id=eFBXeGr4Ps- data-wc=38>“I wanted to get it in my bones,” Taylor explained. “I wanted to be so over-rehearsed that I could be silly with the fans and not lose my train of thought. Learning choreography is not my strong suit.”&nbsp;</p><p id=eKlFVHrj0Cw data-wc=17>She credited choreographer Mandy Moore, recommended by her friend Emma Stone, for transforming her relationship with choreography.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d65d73daf214-gettyimages-2152235151.jpg><p id=eHIoyZ6g7CA data-wc=51>“Mandy completely changed my relationship to choreography, and somehow got into my brain and figured out exactly how I would think about things,” Taylor said. Stone’s endorsement carried significant weight: “I’ve known her since we were 17, and I told her all about the tour—I’m always bouncing ideas off my friends.”</p><p id=edGQgtkkXYC data-wc=40>Taylor envisioned the Eras Tour with elements of Broadway and a cinematic experience, showcasing various dance styles and performances. “I wanted it to show people so many different types of dance and performance,” she said. “Em said, ‘Mandy’s your girl.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/01bb837f6e0f-gettyimages-2152514578.jpg><p id=eM29m9pw62j data-wc=53>The 15 UK shows are projected to boost the country’s economy by almost £1 billion.
