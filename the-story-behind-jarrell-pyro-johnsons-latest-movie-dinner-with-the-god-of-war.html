Of course, he had a taste of it as a gaming fan. The developer’s ‘wonderfully crafted narrative and expansive world’ instantly fascinated him, which inspired him to ‘devote so much time to exploring every aspect of the game.’</p><p>Jarrell didn’t waste all his time behind the consoles; he was inspired to venture into film. He has so far starred in over 25 Hollywood films. His most recent movies are; “The Zompocalypse,” “Bradman: The Movie,” “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” “Obstacle Copse,” and “Snowy Glades.”</p><p>And despite his success, Jarrell is not relaxing now. He has more coming. His next self-produced movie, “Dinner with the God of War,” is about to hit the screens.</p><p>To break down this movie, the Lead Editor of <a href=#>Ghanafuo.com</a>, <a href=#>David Mawuli</a>, had an exclusive interview with<strong> Jarrell Pyro Johnson</strong> to discuss his love for video games, the concept behind the movie, the budget, the co-writers, the cast, and the premiere.</p><p></p><p>Born on October 1, 1988, the Compton native made his Hollywood debut in the 2018 drama , “Glass Jaw,” alongside rapper<a href=#> Boosie Badazz</a>, legendary Mexican actor Jaime Camil and American actor Lee Kholafai. Even without pursuing Theatre Arts in his education journey, the Hampton University old student went on to feature in more award-winning movies.</p><p>Today, Jarrell, 34, has established himself as a distinguished actor and filmmaker and is proud to produce top-notch movies with low budgets.</p><p>Discussing the concept behind his latest body of work, “Dinner with the God of War,” Jarrell tells Ghanafuo.com that as a big fan of the “God of War” video game, it inspired him to pursue his dreams. He said the title and concept behind his movie are directly linked to the video game.</p><p>Jarrell settled on the title ‘to reflect a concept of confronting and overcoming adversity.’ He said the concept ‘is expressed through the analogy of sitting down to dinner with Kratos, the mythical war deity of Greek mythology, who has a reputation for being violent and destructive yet formidable.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ghanafuo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jarrell-Pyro-Johnson-1-300x300.jpg><p>“The metaphor suggests that facing difficult challenges should be done in an assertive and disciplined manner like someone having dinner with a powerful but potentially dangerous guest,” Jarrell tells Ghanafuo.com. “By taking this approach, one can master their destiny and overcome whatever obstacles life throws them.”</p><p>Jarrell, <a href=#>a proud father of an 11-year-old son</a>, disclosed that the creative process behind his movie was an ‘adventure’ and an exhilarating challenge.</p><p>“It’s required us to explore the characters and their respective arcs more deeply, finding new ways to make them compelling for a cinematic audience. We’ve also had to immerse ourselves in the rich mythology of Greek gods and goddesses, drawing inspiration from ancient texts to modern interpretations as we work towards creating our own unique version of this incredible world,” he disclosed.</p><p>While writing the movie script, he had two prominent industry names in mind as co-writers; Solar Greye and Christopher Gatrost. For Jarrell, Solar’s incredible work on the “Dungeons & Dragons” game and other tabletop games drew his attention. He also describes Solar as a friend. On why he recruited Christopher Gatrost, Jarrell said Christopher ‘had an impressive resume,’ but the ‘enthusiasm he exuded when discussing the project’ was the deal breaker.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ghanafuo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jarrell-Pyro-Johnson-in-Dinner-with-the-God-of-War-2-300x300.jpg><p>On casting, he said he settled on ‘the most incredible group of talent that could bring this action-packed tale to life’ after never-ending careful considerations.</p><p>“From seasoned mainstay actors who brought a certain gravitas and embodiment to their characters to newcomers bursting with youthful energy, each and every cast member exceeded all my expectations,” he added, “they worked tirelessly together to create something extraordinary.”</p><p>He named Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, and Elijah Wood his favorite cast. Further, he revealed that “each member brings their unique talents to their respective roles to help create an unforgettable cinematic experience that I just can’t get enough of.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ghanafuo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jarrell-Pyro-Johnson-in-Dinner-with-the-God-of-God-3-225x300.jpg><p>“Dinner with the God of War” also stars Niko El Santo Zavero, Michael Beran, Angel Nichole Bradford, David J. Paul, Shawn Alexander Thompson, Peter Stephen Lucic, Robert Bess, Ikeem Boseman, Lora L. Ebadian, Liam Michael, Jake Donald Truitt, and Kristyna Zaharek.</p><p>The movie was produced with zero budget, and the only return on investment Jarrell expects is fan appreciation. Running film production in Hollywood on a low budget can hurt its outcome, but Jarrell believes ‘with a good idea, grit, and tenacity, it is possible to achieve success.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ghanafuo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jarrell-Pyro-Johnson-in-Dinner-with-the-God-of-God-2-225x300.jpg><p>The movie will premiere on YouTube in the Fall or Winter of 2023 before its worldwide premiere. Jarrell also plans to enter film festivals and some competitions before pushing the movie across theaters worldwide.</p><p>“Through all my trials and tribulations, I exemplify what can be achieved when you refuse to give in. All my films, songs, books, educational classes, and speaking engagements are living proof that no matter how bleak a situation might seem, anything is possible with hard work, discipline, and willpower,” Jarrell encourages fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kwamxjKyrqKqpYq%2BmtMinm2aikae%2FprjLZqeyqp9it7C0zaymp6tdoa61sdKtZKanpp6ybrDIp6Weql2strW0jK2fnmWXpLFuu8VmrpqqXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
