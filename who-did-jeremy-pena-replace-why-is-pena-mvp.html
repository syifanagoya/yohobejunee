Why is Pena MVP?</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>Jeremy Joan Peña is a Dominican-American professional baseball shortstop for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB).&nbsp;He attended the University of Maine and played college baseball for the Black Bears.</p><p>The Astros selected Peña in the third round of the 2018 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2022.</p><p>That season, Peña won the AL Gold Glove Award at shortstop, the first rookie to win the award at his position and was named the MVP of both the American League Championship Series and the World Series, becoming the first player to win both awards in the same year.</p><p>Peña was awarded the AL 2022 Gold Glove Award for his play at shortstop. He became the first Astros rookie to win a Gold Glove, and the first rookie ever to win a Gold Glove at shortstop in MLB history.</p><p>The Houston chapter of the Baseball Writers’ Association of America (BBWAA) named Peña the Astros’ Rookie of the Year.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-did-jeremy-pena-replace></span>Who did Jeremy Pena replace?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Houston Astros Replaced Carlos Correa with Jeremy Pena. Last March, Correa signed a three-year contract worth $105.3 million with the Minnesota Twins, with a player option after each season.</p><p>Instead of fishing from a star-studded free agent pond, the Astros replaced Correa internally, promoting 24-year-old, Triple-A shortstop Jeremy Pena to the big leagues, and making him their opening-day shortstop, a title he would not relinquish.</p><p>With Pena at short, not only did the Astros repeat as American League West champions, but they won 11 more games in 2022 (106) than they did in 2021 (95) with Correa&nbsp;manning the position.</p><p>In 2022, Pena would outperform Correa in Defensive Runs Saved (16 to 3), Outs Above Average (7 to -3) and Defensive WAR (2.4 to 1.1), while playing the same number of games (136).</p><p>Last week, Pena was awarded the American League Gold Glove Award at the shortstop position for his defensive excellence. It was just one of many awards that he would add to his trophy case this fall.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-pena-mvp></span>Why is Pena MVP?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The Houston Astros are the 2022 World Series champions and rookie shortstop Jeremy Peña is the World Series MVP.</p><p>Peña was named World Series MVP after going 2 for 4 in the Game 6 win over the Philadelphia Phillies (HOU 4, PHI 1) and 10 for 25 (.400) with a home run in the series. He played splendid defence at shortstop as well.</p><p>In Game 6, Peña singled twice,&nbsp;including ahead of Yordan Alvarez’s game-winning three-run home run. He socked the go-ahead solo home run as part of a three-hit effort in Game 5 as well.</p><p>Peña had a hit in all six World Series games and finished the postseason with a seven-game hitting streak dating back to the ALCS. He is the first rookie with a hit in six consecutive World Series games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqltcNmoZ6qlaLGbrzEp5hmqpWluaKvxGauobFdnsBuvMSnmGalpqV8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JoltVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
